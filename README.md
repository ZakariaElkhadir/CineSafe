# CineSafe

This project is currently under development. I am working on the design: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/j10hdTjQNBUvJuA1TodK6d/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=wtjMMQJ4m2vmfYrA-1)

**Note:** This project relies on a private API key stored in a `.env` file. Use the provided `set_api.sh` script to automatically set up the virtual environment with the necessary API key. Run the script whit this Command ```./set_api.sh``` before starting the development server to ensure the project functions correctly.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
```bash
npm install # Install the project dependencies
./set_api.sh # Set up the virtual environment with the  API key
npm run dev # Run the development server
```
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
